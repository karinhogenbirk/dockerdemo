## What

This repository contains a simple app to try out Docker. 

## How

I have used online content to learn how to work with Docker. This app collects messages from senders that I wanted to add to a database. 
The containers used are mongo and mongo-express. Eventually, I have built my own image with Docker. 

## What I have learned 

This was my first time using Docker. What I have learned: 
- What Docker is, and why it is essential to learn 
- How to run docker containers 
- How to let docker containers communicate using docker-compose 
- Writing a Dockerfile 
- Building my own docker image 
- How to debug docker (logs, exec)
- Various docker commands
